Ensure you have a folder called Data that contains all the array text files in it. 

On the same level you need to create InsertionSort folder with InsertionSort.java class

On the same level you need to create MergeSort folder with MergeSortAlgorithm.java class

Save the Driver.java on the same level as others. Use this to invoke the sorting algorithms.
The program will require the user to repond with appropriate choice to invoke the respective
alogrithm. Once the correct input is registed, it will start the execution of all files 
stored in Data folder one by one and print the exectuion start, execution end and resulting
execution time for each txt (array) file.
